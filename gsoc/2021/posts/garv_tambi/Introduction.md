# GSoC'21 RoboComp project: Computer vision for detecting elements of a vehicleâ€™s environment with RoboComp


24th June, 2021

## About me

Hey there! My name is **Garv Tambi**. I am a pre-final year undergraduate pursuing B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering(ECE) from the LNM Institute of Information Technology, Jaipur, India.

I have a programming background as my university courses introduced me to the basics of programming. I developed a keen interest in Application Development. I began programming in my freshman year and have continued it. My main focus at start was in Data Science as well as in Competitive Programming and I used it to develop my coding skills and DS/algorithm implementation. I also have a good knowledge of Computer Vision as well as Deep Learning and have successfully completed various projects.



## About the Project

The detection of risk situations during the navigation of mobile robots is an essential task for future applications. The goal is to create a software agent in robocomp with the aim of improving vehicle driving, using deep learning and computer vision techniques.

The main idea is to use one of several RGB cameras placed in a vehicle for lane detection, pedestrian detection, vehicle detection, sign detection and more elements that affect driving. To perform this task, it is possible to work either with real datasets of cameras placed in vehicles or to use the carla vehicle driving simulator.
