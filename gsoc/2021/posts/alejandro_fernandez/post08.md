# Conclusion

_16 August, 2021_

## Experience

This was my first time in GSOC and I must admit that the first weeks I was a little lost, but lucky after these weeks I could adapt to the type of work that this project requires. I can say that this has been an interesting experience as is very different from a normal work in software enginnering. In other words, in these projects you have plenty freedom to take the decisions that you consider better, meanwhile in a normal job usually you have a clear path to follow.

## New knowledge and skills

Thanks to this project I have improved my use of Git and also I have learned the flexibility and options of the language Markdown for writing lot of diffrent things. Also, I have discovered a great library of distribute programming call [Ice](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice) that it is used by RoboComp and Learnblock for stablishing the communication between the differents component, other improvement in my skills was the use of the Tensorflow Lite that before I practically did not used and it is a effective way of implementing neural networks in low computational environments.

## Final conclusion

In general, this experience has been great and has allowed me to done a real project that will benefit my career. If I have the opportunity I will repeat it with any doubt.
