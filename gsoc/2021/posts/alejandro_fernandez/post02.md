# Evaluation of the models

_25 June, 2021_

## Introduction

We have five different models to evaluate:

- **Faster R-CNN ResNet 50 V1 640x640**
- **SSD MobileNet v2 320x320**
- **CenterNet HourGlass104 Keypoints v2 512x512**
- **CenterNet MobileNetV2 FPN 512x512**
- **EfficientDet D0 512x512**

All these models have been got from [TensorFlow 2 Detection Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md) and have been trained in the [COCO 2017 dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home).

## Metrics

The metrics are going to be the typical used in the COCO dataset, apart from them we have added the average prediction time and the necessary memory as they have an important role in low computational environments. The average prediction time information have been got from the repository of the models as is standardized and the necessary memory has been measured according the weight of the compressed file that have all necessary to use the model. Respect to the metrics of the COCO dataset have been obtained doing the evaluation in the validation dataset of COCO 2017.

## Development

Firstly, we need to transform the dataset to a compatible format (tfrecord), we can get the data in this format using this [script](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/f98f000a6e76f7889953097769745ff28289d0d0/research/object_detection/dataset_tools/create_coco_tf_record.py) from the [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/f98f000a6e76f7889953097769745ff28289d0d0/research/object_detection).

After that, the process is pretty straightforward so we need only to execute the following command in the directory research in the repository of the models with each model:

    python object_detection/model_main_tf2.py 
    --pipeline_config_path=PIPELINE_CONFIG_PATH 
    --model_dir=MODEL_DIR
    --checkpoint_dir=CHECKPOINT_DIR 
    --alsologtostderr
  
  Only is necessary to configure the pipeline config with the path of the label map and the data converted to tfrecord. Also, all the files for the command are provided by the compressed file downloaded from the repository.
