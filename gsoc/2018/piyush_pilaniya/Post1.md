## Introduction

My name is Piyush Pilaniya. I am a second year undergraduate student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Sciences from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Ropar. I am a participant of the Google Summer of Code Programme, 2018, and will be working throughout the summer trying to make valuable contributions to RoboComp. 

I am always been excited for the open source concept and want to try my best to contribute efficiently in open sources and Gsoc is great program to dive right into the middle of open source development. This excites me to work with such a big open source organizations with core developers. I chose this particular organization that is RoboComp because it is well aligned with my interest and to what I worked in past.

## About my GSoC project : Integrating MORSE Human-robot interaction simulator with RoboComp

The Modular Open Robots Simulation Engine (MORSE) is a robotic simulation software and a framework to evaluate robotic algorithms and their integration in complex environment.

Currently, RoboComp uses RoboComp InnerModel Simulator (RCIS) tool for the simulation which has several limitation. Thus the idea would be simply to utilise the feature of Morse in the RoboComp architecture for better and improved simulations.

The integration with Morse will be extremely useful and benefitial. Morse is generic simulator for academic robots. It comes with a set of standard sensors, actuators and robots which fulfils the demand. It uses OpenGL-based Blender Game Engine that supports 3D rendering and Integrated Bullet Library for physics simulation.
